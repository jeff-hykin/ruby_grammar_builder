# Auto Setup

TLDR:
- install nix
- run `commands/start` (which uses nix to install everything)
- \* some extra work if you have Windows


### For Windows

* Get [WSL](https://youtu.be/av0UQy6g2FA?t=91) (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or [WSL2](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/how-to-install-wsl2-on-windows-10)<br>
    * If you're not familiar with WSL, I'd recommend [watching a quick thing on it like this one](https://youtu.be/av0UQy6g2FA?t=91)
    * Ubuntu 18.04 for WSL is preferred (same as in that linked video), but Ubuntu 20.04 or similar should work.
    * [WSL2](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/how-to-install-wsl2-on-windows-10) (just released August 2020) is needed if you want to use your GPU.<br>
* Once WSL is installed (and you have a terminal logged into WSL) follow the Mac/Linux instructions below.
* (tip: when accessing WSL, you probably want to use the VS Code terminal, or the [open source windows terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) instead of CMD)


<!-- 
Altertive instructions if GUI is needed (matplotlib, tkinter, qt, etc)

### For Windows

* Normally you just install [WSL](https://youtu.be/av0UQy6g2FA?t=91) and everything works, however the project uses a GUI and WSL doesn't like GUI's. <br>So there are a few options:
    1. You might just want to try manually installing everything (manual install details at the bottom)
    2. (Recommended) Install [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and setup Ubuntu 18.04 or Ubuntu 20.04
        - Here's [a 10 min tutorial](https://youtu.be/QbmRXJJKsvs?t=62) showing all the steps
        - Once its installed, boot up the Ubuntu machine, open the terminal/console app and follow the Linux instructions below
    3. Get WSL2 with Ubuntu, and use Xming

        - Once you have a WSL/Ubuntu terminal setup, follow the Linux instructions below

### For Mac/Linux

* Run the following in your console/terminal app to install [nix](https://nixos.org/guides/install-nix.html)
    * `[ -z "$(command -v "curl")" ] && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install curl` (making sure you have curl)
    * `eval "$(curl -fsSL git.io/JE2Zm)"`
* Run `nix-env -i git` to get `git` (if you don't already have git)
* Clone/Open the project
    * `cd wherever-you-want-to-save-this-project`<br>
    * `git clone https://github.com/*this-repo-url*`
    * `cd *this-repo*`
* Actually run some code
    * run `commands/start` to get into the project environment
        * Note: this will almost certainly take a while the first time because it will auto-install exact versions of everything: `bash`, `grep`, `ruby`, all ruby gems, etc
    * run `project commands` to re-list the project commands
